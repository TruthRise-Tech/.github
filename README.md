## 🌍 Mission

Build the world’s most trusted, accessible, and effective antifraud infrastructure — empowering victims, SMEs, experts, and institutions with AI-driven intelligence, structured case workflows, and pre-transaction scam prevention (Signals).

## 🔧 What we build

TruthRise Tech develops the core technology behind TruthRise’s 4-pillar ecosystem:

### **1. AI Case Agent (Victim-Centric)**
A guided, step-by-step reporting flow that transforms chaotic scam experiences into clean, structured, investigation-ready cases.

### **2. Real-Time Preventive Signals**
A proactive layer that warns victims **before** they transfer money, send crypto, share credentials, or engage with a scammer.

### **3. Community & Expert Marketplace**
A trusted ecosystem where security experts can validate cases, support victims, and provide insights.

### **4. Recovery & Reintegration Layer**
Guidance, tools, and support flows for victim recovery and long-term protection.
